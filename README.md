# Xdebug Flamechart Converter

Converts an [Xdebug profile](http://www.xdebug.org/docs/profiler) to a .cpuprofile file that can be viewed as a flamechart with Chrome Developer Tools.

## How to use

* Create a profile with Xdebug (see [here](http://www.xdebug.org/docs/profiler#starting) and (for web pages) [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xdebug-helper/eadndfjplgieldjbigjakmdgkmoaaaoc)) 
* Open the [Converter](http://andrekr.github.io/XdebugFlamechartConverter/profile_converter.html) in a browser
* Drop the Cachegrind file onto that page, a download will start
* Open Developer Tools (F12), go to Profiles Tab
* Click "Load" and load the downloaded file

## Converting large files

To convert really large files, there is also a version for Node.js.

Usage: `node profile_converter.js <path to xdebug profile> [<depth limit>]`

Example: `node profile_converter.js /path/to/profile.cachegrind 15`

The result will be written to `PHP.cpuprofile` next to the input file, ready for Chrome to be read (see above).

If the output file is already too large to be read by Chrome, a depth limit can be specified. In this case functions that are lower in the flamechart are not included.

## Limitations

* Xdebug does not give information about *when*, within one function, another function is called. The Flamechart Converter just shows all called functions in the middle of each calling function
* Xdebug stores the durations with a relatively low resolution (the unit is 10 Âµs, effectively the resolution is lower), so many small functions end up with a time of 0. To make them visible in the flamechart, the Converter shows them with 100 ns. Theoretically, when a function makes thousands of small function calls but has no *self* time, this can increase the displayed duration of that function a bit.
